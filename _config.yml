  I am a programmer by profession. This is a place where I intend to write useful things
  that I encounter in my professional life. I want to use this site as a notepad which I can come back later
  and use it as a reference.
  I also like to write. So there might be a couple of posts where I would try to make sincere efforts to write
  something good and interesting.
baseurl: "" # the subpath of your site, e.g. /blog/
url: "http://blog.aashd.me" # the base hostname & protocol for your site
github_username:  geeky-sh
