  I am a Software Engineer by profession. This is a place where I intend to write useful things
  that I encounter in my professional life.<br/>
  I like to read litrary books. I also like to write about my life experiences at times. So, there may be a couple of posts where I would try to make sincere efforts to write
  something good and interesting.
baseurl: "" # the subpath of your site, e.g. /blog/
url: "http://geeky-sh.github.io" # the base hostname & protocol for your site
