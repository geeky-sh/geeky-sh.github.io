<div dir="ltr" style="text-align: left;" trbidi="on"><div style="margin-bottom: 0in;">I have an urge to write down the thoughts of mine, since quite a long time. I always desired to write whatever comes to my mind, but unfortunately, it went blank every time I sat down to write. Thankfully, this time around, there are some things lingering in my mind, that I want to jot it down. For now, the reasons to write these things down is to clear out my thoughts, be sure of what I want to do with my plan, maintain an account of my thoughts which I can go back to later.  </div><div style="margin-bottom: 0in;"><br /></div><div style="margin-bottom: 0in;">When I read the blogs of others amateur writers trying out their literary skills, most of the time, it consists of some short story where they can pour out their imagination and showcase their creative aptitude. I, on the other hand, tend to write out about myself, my goals, my ambition, about the things I learnt along the way. I feel like, currently I might be lacking in the imaginary skills that is required of me. Nevertheless, I feel that writing the observations made to understand the mysteries of life is also useful. Still, someday, I would definitely try out my hand at writing short stories and try to experience the thrill of the process.</div><div style="margin-bottom: 0in;"><br /></div><div style="margin-bottom: 0in;">I am a programmer. I program to build features of a website and also solve technical problems that come along the way. I, always, am occupied with this strong feeling that there is more to me than to just being a common programmer. I want to do something that is completely different from what other people of my age would do. Most importantly, I don't want to be stuck on doing mundane job day in and day out. I want to do something challenging, intellectually absorbing, something that excites the very core of me. Perhaps this is the reason why I want to pursue Masters from a foreign university, because, somehow I feel that the research opportunities provided to me over there would be ample enough to placate my so-called over-ambitious needs. Even this urge and act of penning down my thoughts have stemmed from the thoughts of doing something different apart from work.</div><div style="margin-bottom: 0in;"><br /></div><div style="margin-bottom: 0in;">Meanwhile, effort is always undertaken to understand who I am, what I want and what would probably be the best conditions where I may perform to my utopian best. Recently I have been reading quite a number of posts related to understanding introverts. I, and the people around me, have always perceived me as a quiet and always-to-himself person. This was the reason why I am always fascinated to read more about introverts and how they come to fit in an out-going society because I feel myself as one having difficulties with communicating with the people who I am not closely associated with. But, reading these posts, I came to know, that the first thing for an introvert to feel happy about himself and contribute to the optimum level in a society, both in a direct and indirect manner, is to embrace his introversion. Introverts are good the way they are, its the job of the people around him to appreciate his nature rather than he, in order to fit himself in, try to be someone he is not. After reading all these and trying to apply the same in my day to day life. I am able to live more happily than before. Being more of a into-himself, and self-obsessed person. I feel being the same way every moment, is actually helping me understand myself in a better way. I am able to look through the foul and the best parts of my behavior. I am able to dissect different parts of me, try to understand their importance, their meaning, their paradoxes and know why they exist as a part of my life.  </div><div style="margin-bottom: 0in;"><br /></div><div style="margin-bottom: 0in;">Here are the references to know more about introverts:</div><div style="margin-bottom: 0in;"><a href="http://www.quora.com/Introverts-and-Introversion-2">http://www.quora.com/Introverts-and-Introversion-2</a></div><div style="margin-bottom: 0in;"><a href="http://www.ted.com/talks/susan_cain_the_power_of_introverts.html">http://www.ted.com/talks/susan_cain_the_power_of_introverts.html</a></div><br /><div style="margin-bottom: 0in;"><br /></div></div>
