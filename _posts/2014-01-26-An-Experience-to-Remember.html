<div dir="ltr" style="text-align: left;" trbidi="on"><div dir="ltr" style="line-height: 1.15; margin-bottom: 0pt; margin-top: 0pt;"><span style="background-color: transparent; color: black; font-family: Arial; font-size: 15px; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">Sitting with the bunch of students, I, being one of them, felt completely lost. I was oblivious of the coming lecture. Didn’t know who the professor was. The feeling of blankness was weird, considering the fact that I got decent grades. The benches, were surprisingly designed for only one student. One student per bench. I felt comfortable. Finally the teacher arrived. It was difficult to recognize his face. I hadn’t seen him before. So he started with some jokes, to which all the students were laughing except me. I was clueless. Anyways, the teacher told that since its the first day of the week, he won’t be teaching anything, but would be asking questions and hold discussions of what happened last week. Out of nowhere, he again, cracked some funny joke and all the students burst out laughing. Everyone seemed excited at the idea that they would be asked questions. This was the first time, I felt that I was completely out of ground over here. Totally unprepared, unaware of the subject, unrecognizable face of the teacher, all these things made me a bit scared. </span></div><b id="docs-internal-guid-1ed7c784-cf29-1201-9334-9e75aabb5010" style="font-weight: normal;"><br /><span style="background-color: transparent; color: black; font-family: Arial; font-size: 15px; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;"></span></b><div dir="ltr" style="line-height: 1.15; margin-bottom: 0pt; margin-top: 0pt;"><span style="background-color: transparent; color: black; font-family: Arial; font-size: 15px; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">So the round of questions began. He was asking randomly, allowing the students to raise their hand and answer them. Sometimes, he even pointed out a particular student and asked him a specific question. I felt frightened by this. I felt that he had noticed my fear, and was eagerly waiting to give me a chance to answer a &nbsp;simple question. After listening to the bunch of questions, I suddenly realized, that the subject being discussed about here was Physics! Suddenly the professor pointed at me, and asked me a really easy question. I could feel it as easy, because all the students were eagerly looking at the teacher, so that even if he makes a single expression of approval to any one of them, they would blurt out the answer. I, completely listless, stared at him. He seemed disgusted by me and turned away leaving the question to be answered by someone else. I felt relieved that I was not punished, because by the look of his face, I felt like I had done the worst crime possible. </span></div><b style="font-weight: normal;"><br /><span style="background-color: transparent; color: black; font-family: Arial; font-size: 15px; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;"></span></b><div dir="ltr" style="line-height: 1.15; margin-bottom: 0pt; margin-top: 0pt;"><span style="background-color: transparent; color: black; font-family: Arial; font-size: 15px; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">In the meanwhile, a friend of mine, on the front bench, turned to me and started pulling some joke on the teacher. In reply , I smiled and the professor caught hold of my sight. He got a perfect opportunity to lend me a harsh punishment. Rushing towards me with an evil smile that finally he found someone that he can spurt his anger on, he took my hand, grabbed me forward and started hitting me on the back, simultaneously pushing towards the door to throw me out of the class. </span></div><b style="font-weight: normal;"><br /><span style="background-color: transparent; color: black; font-family: Arial; font-size: 15px; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;"></span></b><div dir="ltr" style="line-height: 1.15; margin-bottom: 0pt; margin-top: 0pt;"><span style="background-color: transparent; color: black; font-family: Arial; font-size: 15px; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">First thing that came to my mind while getting hit - that this is not me. I rarely go to classes unprepared. Even if I do, I am not so dumb to have forgotten the name and face of such a terrible teacher. I would surely remember him. I was pleased with my thoughts at that moment. I never thought so much before. Then, I suddenly realized that I am not in a school anymore. I got a decent job, a good life. So why am I present in the school, as a student? After thinking for some time, it dawned on me that I was in a dream. I felt surprised that I could be conscious in my dream too. This had never happened before. I thought that instead of being awed at the events, I should better try to handle them. I was being beaten mercilessly, but the teacher seemed to have just started. Suddenly I got a really amazing thought. Why don’t I make the most of this dream, do something that I wouldn’t have even dreamt about, try to fulfill all my dark fantasies (:evil smile:).</span></div><b style="font-weight: normal;"><br /><span style="background-color: transparent; color: black; font-family: Arial; font-size: 15px; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;"></span></b><div dir="ltr" style="line-height: 1.15; margin-bottom: 0pt; margin-top: 0pt;"><span style="background-color: transparent; color: black; font-family: Arial; font-size: 15px; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">I don’t know how did it came there.but I suddenly grabbed the iron pipe and hit the teacher on his head. I took care &nbsp;not to hit him too hard that he start bleeding but intense enough that he start screaming. Next, I ran from there as fast as I could with the pipe in hand. My class was on the third floor, and I wanted to reach the ground. I wanted to find some nice teachers on the way, if possible, and thank them for everything that they did for me. There were two three names that came to my mind. So hoping to find them while running, I reached the play ground. Sadly I wasn't able to find anyone. I didn't know why I was in a hurry, trying to do everything as fast as possible. Reaching the ground, I suddenly found my classmate whose presence really irked me. He was someone who pretended he knew everything but was a dumb ass in reality. I felt a surge of anger and excitement, and ran towards him with the pipe. On seeing me, he ran too. I stopped midway trying to catch my breath. I had never run so much before. He, standing a few paces away from me, was giggling at me. I felt angry again and resumed running.&nbsp;</span></div><div dir="ltr" style="line-height: 1.15; margin-bottom: 0pt; margin-top: 0pt;"><span style="background-color: transparent; color: black; font-family: Arial; font-size: 15px; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;"><br /></span></div><div dir="ltr" style="line-height: 1.15; margin-bottom: 0pt; margin-top: 0pt;"><span style="background-color: transparent; color: black; font-family: Arial; font-size: 15px; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">On the way, my sight caught hold of a beautiful computer science teacher who was talking to someone. She wore a glittering black and white dress, her head covered in a black dupatta. She was insanely cute, with her fair skin in perfect contrast with what she was wearing. I was her favorite student as I used to get really good marks in her subject. Then I thought suddenly, that this probably might be the only dream, in which I am perfectly aware of who I am. What should I possibly do. to make this dream the perfect dream ever? Finding my answer, I stopped running, forgot about that irking boy, dropped the pipe and started moving towards her. I was careful, that she doesn’t recognize someone rushing towards her. Finally, standing beside her, before she could see me, I tried to grab her, with a surprisingly strong force. She fell into my arms, and before I or she, could think of something, I kissed her. I felt my lips touching hers delicately and it felt like the most wonderful thing ever happening to me. I wouldn’t let go of her lips. I took care not to push myself too much to make her feel uncomfortable. I wanted her to have a memorable experience too. She resisted initially but gave away in few moments.</span></div><b style="font-weight: normal;"><br /><span style="background-color: transparent; color: black; font-family: Arial; font-size: 15px; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;"></span></b><div dir="ltr" style="line-height: 1.15; margin-bottom: 0pt; margin-top: 0pt;"><span style="background-color: transparent; color: black; font-family: Arial; font-size: 15px; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">Accomplished almost everything that I had thought of, I opened my eyes to the dim reality.</span></div><br /><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 15px; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;"></span></div>
