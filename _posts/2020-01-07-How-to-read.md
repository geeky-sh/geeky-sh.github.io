# How to read?

I want to elaborate on how I should read to entail maximum benefit from the activity.

1. Break down the sentence into each word and consume each with the intention of understand why it is used. Donâ€™t get a cursory glance. Instead break each sentence down to a point where I am able to understand its true intention of  use
2. Try to relate whatever sentence I read with the previous sentence. Try to understand why the author is trying to tell. Understand the why and how.
3. After the paragraph is over, pause for few moments to understand what I had just read. If possible write a gist of it somewhere so that it gets written down in my memory
4. After the whole article is over, write down the gist of it along with my thoughts on the same. Understand the tone of the article.
5. Try not to rush through the process in order to complete more things in less time.
