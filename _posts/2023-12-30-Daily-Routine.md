Daily routine is very important for a human being. It is like a rock that stands erected against the daily thrashings and vicissitudes of life. It helps one not feel dejected when it seems that fate has turned its back against us. When everything in life seems out of control, having and following a routine makes us feel that at least a few things are in our control.

For years, I have been putting in persistent effort in forming a routine and sticking to it diligently. There are times when I can do everything extremely well, there are times when I can partially make it, and there are ones when I lag off far behind.

The good part, however, in all this is my firm and irrefutable belief that routine is the key to having a fulfilling day. While that are a lot of other factors that come into play in determining the success of a day, completing a routine gives us a strong boost towards achieving that. It is like having a strong opening partnership in the game of Cricket. Openers, when they give a blazing start to the game, provide an intense confidence boost to the rest of the batsmen coming after them, allowing them to play more freely and confidently.

Next, I will go into the constituents of a routine that I think are important in today's day and age.

As part of having a routine, I think waking up early, at a self-decided hour plays an important role in determining how the rest of our day plays out. Firstly, it gives us more time to ourselves. In an increasingly connected world where every second of our day is spent doing something - be it working, commuting, spending time with our loved ones, reading and following the lives of our virtual connections, and even after all that spend the last chunks of our restive time in endlessly scrolling on social media, navigating and swiping the lives of total strangers - all this is led to us having no time for ourselves. Thus, an early morning's earned silence plays a very crucial part in providing us with the motivation and strength to tackle any and every difficulty hurled at us during the day.

Secondly, exercising daily should be a very important part of a routine. In these times, when a lot of our jobs are mostly sedentary and require very little or no bodily movement, our bodies naturally become used to being lethargic. This bodily behavior then leads to our overall personality and mental being mimicking the same. Hence we too feel lazy and sleepy most of the time. Then, there comes the obvious effect of our fitness levels going to the dumpster and our health taking a downturn which then enters into a vicious cycle when we start building harmful eating habits due to the obvious frustration caused by our deteriorated well-being. All of that, then needs to be curtailed at the start itself and exercising during the start of the day provides us with the strength, agility and confidence to get through the rest of the day with ease.

Lastly, I believe meditation should be included as a compulsory addition to our daily routine. In an increasingly fleeting world where we are exposed more than ever to everyone through our smartphones, where we spend more time looking, experiencing and judging other's lives through their 8 min. videos than earnestly contemplating over and evaluating our wasted time and work actively towards improving oneself, we are willingly and swiftly moving towards our unhappiness and suffering. Here, meditation can act as a soothing balm over our self-inflicted wounds. It can reverse and in some cases eradicate the damage we have done to our mental well-being by dumping a barrage of emotions daily through our swiping habits. Meditating daily, consistently, sincerely and dedicatedly will improve our mental and emotional being and keep our mind-space clear, receptive and attentive towards gathering more knowledge and wisdom from our daily activities.
